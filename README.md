### Prerequisites üìã

The things you will need to install the software are a computer that isn't too old, a text editor to help you read all the code with pretty colors, and the will to deal with code written by a growing developer!

### Installation üîß

1. Clone the repositories to your local machine: 
```
git clone git@github.com:JuanCamiloClement/elemental-frontend.git
```

and

```
git clone git@github.com:JuanCamiloClement/elemental-backend.git
```

2. Change directory to /elemental-frontend:
```
cd elemental-frontend
```

Also change to /elemental-backend in the second repository:
```
cd elemental-backend
```

3. Install the frontend and backend dependencies:

Make sure to have installed Node.js:
```
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```

Then, run npm install on each of the repositories:
```
npm install
```

4. Create a `.env` file to include the backend URL.
